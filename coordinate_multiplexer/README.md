# coordinate_multiplexer

This folder contains all files for describing and testing the coordinate multiplexer component.

This component has four 5 bit input busses, which describe a total of two possible coordinates (row and column number each 5 bit).
Furhtermore, it takes one input signal, called the "select" signal, which determines which of the two 5 bit input busses are passed through to the two 5 bit output busses.
